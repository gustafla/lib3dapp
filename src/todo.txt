    - Static struct in global scope?
    - In Graphics that gets instanced in Game?
        - May the Graphics object contain reference to all resources as well?
            - YES!
                - But free unneeded and reload between scenes to save GPU memory
text string drawing
MapObject class
    - size
    - pointer to mesh etc
    - solid
    - objects class with an array of every object in game
        - "Object IDs"
Shared resources?
Map
    - Is a list of each object
        - Or an array for each tile?
            - Should consider baking to a big static mesh
                - Texturing becomes harder
